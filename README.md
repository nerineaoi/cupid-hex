# Cupid Hex
"A blursed romance where fate plays dirty." 

Cupid Hex is a supernatural chat-based otome where one choice locks your fate. Swipe once, commit fully, and let the hex decide how love plays out.

# Alea Iacta Est - Chat Otome Game

> *"The die is cast. There is no turning back."*

A supernatural chat-based otome mobile game built on Ren'Py, featuring timed conversations, meaningful choices, and a swipe-to-match dating app interface where commitment is permanent and fate is fluid.

## 🎮 Project Status

**Current Phase:** Demo Development (Days 1-3)  
**Engine:** Ren'Py 8.0.3 + Mysterious Messenger Framework  
**Platform Target:** Mobile (Android/iOS)  
**Demo Scope:** ~10,000 words, 3 love interests, 3 in-game days

---

## 🌙 Core Concept

Players interact with a supernatural dating app where they swipe through potential matches. Once committed to a character, the route locks—mirroring real dating app exclusivity but with supernatural consequences. The game embraces timed chats, meaningful choices without hand-holding, and fair monetization that never sells "correct" answers directly.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Swipe-to-match mechanic (MeChat-inspired)
- 3-day common route before route lock
- Dual currency system (farmable + premium)
- Timeline/save mechanics framed narratively
- Meta-awareness without punishment
- Realistic phone interface (WhatsApp-style chat hub)

## 🎯 Demo Love Interests

| Character    | Type       | Route Theme                                 |
|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Merman**   | Paranormal | Ocean mystery, isolation vs connection      |
| **Werewolf** | Paranormal | Duality, instinct vs control                |
| **Human**    | Human      | Grounded reality, normalcy vs extraordinary |

*Non-chosen characters appear as silhouettes after commitment.*
